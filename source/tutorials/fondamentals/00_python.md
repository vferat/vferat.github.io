# Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, object oriented, interpreted programming language {footcite}`pythonabout`

- high-level: code closely resembles human language and logic: users can focus more on the problem they are trying to solve rather than the intricacies of how the computer executes the code (i.e. how memory is allocated, pointers, types)
- interpreted: the code is executed line by line by an interpreter software (on-the-fly), rather than being compiled into machine code before execution. This allows for Dynamic Typing, Interactivity, Portability
- object oriented: a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods) to manipulate that data.
The object 'apple' does not only have a weight apple.weight but can also change itself apple.fall()

## The choice of python for neuroimaging

simplicity and readability
multipurpose
Portability 
License-Free and Open-Source
Integration with Other Environments and Tools

### For education

Python's simplicity and readability (high-level) make it an ideal programming language for educational purposes.
License-Free and Open-Source

### For research

This openness promotes collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency in neuroimaging research, as code and tools can be shared and scrutinized by the community.

### A lot of libraries


## Package managers

### Pypi

### conda


## Installing python

### install miniconda





``````{note}
On windows, if you want to use cmd instead of the anaconda shell ( no recommended), you might need to initialize (only once) conda for cmd. for that, start the anaconda shell, find conda location using "where conda".
Now, on your cmd, use the path to run the following conda script:

```
C:\Users\ferat\AppData\Local\miniconda3\Scripts\conda.exe init cmd.exe
```

``````




### environment managment

conda env list

conda create -n python=

conda activate
