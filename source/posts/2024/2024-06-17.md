# OHBM 2024: EEG microstates neurofeedback for adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder   


## Abstract

EEG neurofeedback (NFB) may represent a new therapeutic opportunity for ADHD, a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by attentional deficits and high impulsivity. 
Several groups have reported abnormal balanced Theta/beta ratio (TBR) such population. Since then, much of the literature has relied on the observation of abnormal TBR in ADHD population to create neurofeedback protocols. However more recent studies have failed to replicate this finding of elevated TBR as a diagnostic feature in ADHD (confirmed in a meta-analysis). These divergent results motivate the need for research to explore new markers to diagnose and treat ADHD.
In our recent work we describe alterations in EEG brain microstates (i.e., recurrent stable periods of short duration) in adult ADHD, potentially representing a biomarker of the disorder.
The present study aims to use neurofeedback to manipulate EEG microstates in ADHD patients and healthy controls, in order to observe the effects on neurophysiological, clinical and behavioural parameters.  
During this on-going study, participants are trained to both upregulate and downregulate microstates parameters. EEG recording at rest as well as continuous performance task (CPT) are recorded before and after 30 minutes of microstate-based neurofeedback training.
 Intra- and across-session statistical contrasts, both in terms of brain activity changes and performance, should provide evidence on the impact of microstate changes relative to ADHD behaviour.
