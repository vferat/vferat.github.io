# About Me

I am a French engineer who started a PhD in neuroscience. I work at the [Functional Brain Mapping Lab](https://www.campusbiotech.ch/en/node/326) where I study brain wave (EEG). . I am particularly interested in EEG microstates for both their theoretical approach and their clinical application and 
currently develop a framework for using these biomarkers as targets for neurofeedback therapies, with a special focus on attention deficit 
populations.

At the same time, I try to play your part by making analysis tools and techniques accessible to the largest number of people. I have the deep conviction that this is the key element that will advance our knowledge about the brain. That is why I actively participate in the development of the open source python ecosystem: I contribute to libraries such as [nipype](https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html), and complement them with libraries I wrote such as [Pycartool](https://pycartool.readthedocs.io/en/latest) and [Pycrostates](https://pycrostates.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
