# About Me

I am a passionate French engineer and post-doctoral researcher focused on transforming neuroscience research into practical solutions for society. I believe that achieving this requires scientific outputs to be reproducible and scalable, which drives my work in two key areas:

- **EEG Neurofeedback**: Leveraging EEG, the most affordable neuroimaging method, to develop neurofeedback interventions that could benefit both clinical and non-clinical populations.
- **Reproducible and Scalable Neuroimaging Pipelines**: Building robust analysis pipelines to ensure reproducibility and scalability in neuroimaging research.

My work is shaped by collaborations with four different labs, allowing me to push the boundaries in both fields. With the [Sleep and Cognition Neuroimaging Laboratory](https://neurocenter-unige.ch/research-groups/sophie-schwartz/) (Prof. Sophie Schwartz) for fMRI and the [Neuroling](https://neuroling.github.io/index.html) (Prof. Alexis Hervais-Adelman) for MEG, I develop and apply advanced analysis pipelines using industry-grade technologies such as Docker and GitHub integration.

In collaboration with [Dr. Tomas Ros](https://cibm.ch/community/tomas-ros/) as well as the [Laboratory for Behavioral Neurology and Imaging of Cognition](https://neurocenter-unige.ch/research-groups/patrik-vuilleumier/) (Prof. Patrik Vuilleumier), I continue developing EEG neurofeedback paradigms. Pursuing my PhD work, I'm designing clinical trials to test the feasibility and efficacy of new home-based EEG neurofeedback paradigms.

A core part of my mission is to make the tools and techniques I develop accessible to as many people as possible. I firmly believe that democratizing access to research tools is key to advancing our understanding of the brain. This is why I contribute to the open-source Python ecosystem, working on libraries like [nipype](https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html), as well as creating my own libraries, [Pycartool](https://pycartool.readthedocs.io/en/latest) and [Pycrostates](https://pycrostates.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
